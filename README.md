Project Overview
In this assignment, I performed a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a supermarket sales dataset to uncover key business insights and consumer patterns. The goal of this analysis was to understand the data representation, identify missing values or outliers, and discover relationships between variables that influence sales performance and customer satisfaction.

Dataset Description
The dataset used is SuperMarket Analysis.csv, which contains 1,000 historical sales records from a supermarket company across three different branches.

Key Features: Invoice ID, Branch, City, Customer Type, Gender, Product Line, Unit Price, Quantity, Tax, Sales, Date, Time, Payment Method, and Rating.
